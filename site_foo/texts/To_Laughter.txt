To Laughter—
Thy friends were never mine thou heartless
     fiend:
Silence and solitude & calm & storm,
Hope, before whose veiled shrine all
spirits bend
In worship, & the rainbow vested form
Of concience, that within thy hollow heart
Can find no throne—the love of such great
    powers
Which has requited mine in many hours
Of loneliness, thou ne’er hast felt; depart!
Thou canst not bear the moons great eye, thou
     fearest
A fair child clothed in smiles—aught that is high
Or good or beautiful.—Thy voice is dearest
To those who mock at truth & Innocency
I, now alone, weep without shame to see
How many broken hearts lie bare to thee.
